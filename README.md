# diabetes_prediction
We develop an algorithm for predicting whether a person is Diabetic or Non-Diabetic based on inputs such as: Age, Gender, BMI, High Blood Pressure, FBS, HbA1c Leverls, smoker/non-smoker.
The algorithm uses logistic regression due to multiple feature usage. Various measurments of the algorithm (True Positive, Accuracy, Precision,etc.) are also available in the file.
The dataset used is from Kaggle and is available here : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/simaanjali/diabetes-simple-diagnosis.
